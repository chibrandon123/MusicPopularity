# Analyzing Music Popularity based on song characteristics

- Research Question: Are there correlations between a song's popularity and its compositional features? To give an example, does a song's tempo, duration, or loudness affect its popularity?

## Why is song popularity important?
- What is the most famous celebrity you can think of that lived in the 18th century? For us, its a Austrian Piano Composer whose work can be deemed timeless. Personally, we believe that music is much more than a combination of sounds but rather a form of expression and human emotion. Music helps foster relationships with others as similar tastes in certain genres can indicate common interest and perspective. We want to answer the question of why people have such a strong attraction towards certain songs: what is it about different artists and their music that makes people so passionate about their work?
- Understanding what makes a song popular can give valuable insight to aspiring artists on how they should be crafting their music but we think answering this question also gives a better perception of what we value as music lovers.
